# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide for developing a machine learning pipeline, including preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model training/testing.

## Features
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Loads data from a CSV file (`placement.csv`).

2. **Preprocessing and EDA**:
   - Explores the dataset and cleans it to prepare for analysis.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Selects important features for better model performance.

4. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Trains models using the prepared data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run cells step-by-step to process the data and train models.
3. Analyze results and tweak parameters for better performance.

## Files
- `placement.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
